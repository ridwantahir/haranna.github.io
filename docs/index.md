# Guidelines to Author Courses For Oromia Foundation
Here at Oromia Foundation we use a concept called coding your presentation (coding a course) to autor courses. This approach, unlike the traditional WYSIWYG tools, simplifies collaboration, versioning, QA contorl. Furthermore, it helps us keep clean separation between authoring courses and preparing course videos. 

We use a node js app called CodeCourse, that is built on top of the awesome  [Reveal Js](http://revealjs.com/). While [Reveal Js](http://revealjs.com/) is a rich tool, we have added new features on top of [Reveal Js](http://revealjs.com/) and some of the features in [Reveal Js](http://revealjs.com/) are not supported.  

To help us maintian the same standard, we strongly encourage the course authors to follow this guide line.
